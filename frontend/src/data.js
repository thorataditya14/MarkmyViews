If you are able to solve question papers in access of 10 years, you are sure to clear this exam and open new vistas of career and learning. IES Master’s Civil Engineering GATE 2021 gives detailed solutions for the past 35 years question papers. Unlike other GATE solution books published by some of the leading institutes/publishers, the solutions books from IES Master offer topic-wise descriptions. The emphasis is clearly on the understanding of concepts and building upon a holistic picture. So as you finish a topic, say Shear Force and Bending Moment, you will find all the previous years’ question papers with detailed explanation under one topic."
